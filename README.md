<h1>Hi, I'm John-Michael! </h1>

</br> Computer Science student in Masters | Open to apprenticeship opportunities from September 2025

</br> 👀 I’m interested in cloud, AI and cybersecurity!

</br> 🌱 I’m currently making an AI based SIEM tool! I will try to fine tune a model to analyse suspicious log patterns.

</br> ⚡ I have a good understanding of Algorithms, Networks, Data Analysis, Machine Learning and general technical support (ranging from performing OS installations to repairing and upgrading PC components).
